# Vue Portfolio Project

This project is a personal portfolio application built with Vue.js. It showcases a variety of interactive features, including a **Tic-Tac-Toe game**, a **showcase page for achievements**, and custom animations for an engaging user experience. The app is styled with **Bootstrap** for responsiveness and a clean UI, and it utilizes **Vue.js** for the dynamic frontend.

## Features

- **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: A fully functional, interactive game where two players can take turns to play Tic-Tac-Toe. The board is displayed in a 3x3 grid, and the winner is announced when there is a match in any row, column, or diagonal.
  
- **Achievements Showcase**: A page displaying boxes representing different achievements. Each box contains an image and description, and when clicked, a modal opens with more details about the achievement. The boxes animate with a zoom effect as they are clicked.

- **Custom Animations**: On the achievements page, clicking on any achievement box causes it to zoom into the center of the screen, and a modal is displayed with more information.

- **Vue.js and Bootstrap**: The app is built using Vue.js for a reactive and dynamic user interface. Bootstrap is used to style the app, ensuring it’s responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.
